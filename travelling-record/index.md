# Travelling Record

The [Travelling Record](https://www.discogs.com/J%C3%B3nbj%C3%B6rn-Moff-Tarkin-Travelling-Record/release/12924699) is a limited edition record with no permanent owner or home making its way across the world through friendly exchanges.

Its temporary caretakers play the record to interested audiences and then pass it on to other intermediate owners who do the same. You can track how the record travels the world on [travellingrecord.co](http://travellingrecord.co) and follow it on [@TravellingRecord](https://www.instagram.com/travellingrecord/).

More words on the idea and the project over on the [Discogs blog](https://blog.discogs.com/en/travelling-records-globetrotting-tunes-for-a-global-audience/).
